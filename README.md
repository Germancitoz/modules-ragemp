# Modules for [RageMP](https://rage.mp/)

## Goal

Hi everyone, i made this resource because the current resources loader on the server side is very scarce and not personalize, so i decided to make a couple of modifications trying that one as the owner / developer of it can have a more exact control of its resources, models, etc.

## How to install

**1**. For this is necessary to change of directory our ragemp server location because file called updater.exe is going to remove our changes so i recommend you to change that.

**2.** Move all folder of this repo to your server folder (Read step 1) and replace.

**3**. For last, for start some resource you only need to add in resources.js

## Example

- I want to add my '_example_' resource.
